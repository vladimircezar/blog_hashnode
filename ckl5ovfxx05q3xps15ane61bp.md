## A New Hope

I learnt to program in [BASIC](http://basic256.org) on a  [8 bit computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum). My uncle had a [series of books](http://www.8bs.com/inputmagazine.htm) on programming that he graciously lent me despite of the fact I did not have a computer at the time. Since he didn’t either, it never seem to be a big deal to me. I just want to learn about computers. They seemed way far more interesting then my [videogame console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey_2#Brazil): I could control my environment, communicate with other people, play games, and even [start/stop another thermonuclear war](https://www.wired.com/2008/07/ff-wargames/?currentPage=all). What is not to like?

One of the great articles in one of those books was on random numbers, sequences and generators. I was fascinated by it. The text (and associated code) explained not only that computers are unable to generate random numbers but also that we, human, can’t do a better job at that either. I was baffled at this revelation since I thought, as most people do, that come up with a random number after the other is nothing but a trivial task. Anyone, if asked, can engender a fairly large sequence of numbers that is random. Or is it?  [Who cares](https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters/)?

Consider the following exercise. Let A be a set of three elements r, p and s. And let f be a function defined as f(r,p)=p, f(r,s)=r and f(p,s)=s. If you are paying attention you might recognize this. It is a mathematical formulation of the basis of a very well known (and fun) game called Rock-Paper-Scissors. The players are completely free to chose any element (r, p or s) they want to use at each iteration (match). The question is, can the human choose them randomically and therefore generate a random sequence? The article argued that the answer is no. That we, humans are not a quite good sequence random generators as we like to think. That we are biased. To prove this point it asked the reader to type and run a very long BASIC listing. Maybe Today I would think twice but at that age, all one has is time. What I did not have was a computer. So I virtually begged my father for one. And then, in a sunny day, I was interrupted in my reading adventures by the arrival of a second hand (but in impeccable condition) ZX Spectrum that was connect to my TV in such a short time that certainly defied the all physics laws. I was then ready to verify the big claims that by using technics like [Exponential Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing) the computer could actually forecast my “random” moves and, in the long run, beat me to it. And it did. A small step to mankind, be assured, but it changed everything for yours truly.

I was hooked. Well, I was already hooked at that point. What I mean is that I was really, really, into this thing now and I would be for the entirety of my life. I just knew it.
